# DSA-using-CPP
This repo would contain implementations of various data structures and algorithm design methods that I'd practise while learning and revising DSA through C/C++.

## Introduction
Since The initial scope of this repo was just limited to the usage of C but I found C to be very restrictive to my style of programming, so all new programs are written using C++.
Some programs might still be written in C, I'd convert those programs when I find the time to do so. I'm also planning to add the solutions to various LeetCode, HackerRank and CodeChef problems
that I come across. Again, that depends on me finding the time for it.

## How to use this repo?
You're free to fork this repo, clone it on your systems and tinker as you please. Please refrain from pusing any changes to this repo itself.

## How to give suggestions?
You can drop a message at any of my socials if you're facing an issue or need further clarification regarding some code. I'd try to add documentation over time and keep the code as
self-explanatory as possible.
